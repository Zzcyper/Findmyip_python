- The "findmyip" project is a simple Python application that allows you to quickly retrieve your public IP address. It   
provides a straightforward way to obtain your IP address without the need for manual lookup.

- How it works
- When you run the "findmyip" application, it makes an HTTP request to a public IP address API. The API responds with your  
public IP address, which is then displayed on the screen.
